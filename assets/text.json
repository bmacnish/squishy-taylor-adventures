    "chapterOne": "Hi! It’s me, Squishy Taylor. I love solving mysteries! And I’m pretty good at it!\n\nEveryone calls me Squishy but my real name is Sita. I live in the city with my Dad, Alice, Baby and Jessie and Vee, my bonus sisters. I call them that because it’s way better than calling them my step-sisters.\n\nOne of the best things about bonus sisters is sharing a triple bunk bed! Alice built that for us. Alice is Jessie and Vee’s mum. My Mum is living in Geneva at the moment. She’s working for the UN. “Hey kiddo,” she says whenever we Zoom, “tell me all about your day.” And even if she’s in the middle of doing important UN stuff, she listens to me without checking emails or looking at her phone. I miss her so much.\n\nI miss my bonus sisters too! It’s school holidays right now, and Jessie and Vee are visiting their Nai Nai.\n\nI’ve been stuck at home with nothing to do. And then I saw the news today. Did you? I’ve put it on the next page for you to see.\n\nBREAKING NEWS! GHOSTS SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY\n\nThis year, all across the city, we’re getting used to new kinds of neighbours. Ghosts!\n\nWe spoke with part-time nurse, Geoff Kim, about his encounter. “I was coming home late from a shift. I was in my driveway when I heard a loud thud. I looked across the street and I saw a blur of white. It was so quick. And I say ‘it’ because I just knew it wasn’t a person.”\n\nInner-city gallery owner, Jade Mafi, had just closed up a fundraiser exhibition. She was out the back of the gallery. “There are these town-houses, really new ones, just across the alleyway. The outdoor lighting had come on and was glaring. I saw a blur of white sort of tumble down the stairs! And then the lights were cut out. I was terrified.”\n\nTo date, there have been 23 ghost sightings. Who are these ghosts? And what are they doing? We’re calling on everyone to help us solve this mystery!\n\nYES! There’s a mystery to solve.\n\nLet’s start with the facts. Facts—there have been 23 ghost sightings. Three of them have been close to me.\n\nWithout Jessie and Vee here, I need help from new sleuth-buddies. Will you help me solve this mystery? Have you got the right skills?",    "chapterTwo": "You’ve definitely proved that you’re excellent at sleuthing. I’d love for you to solve this ghost mystery with me!\n\nYou’re right. The three places the ghosts have visited near me are the playground, bus shelter and car park. These places have one thing in common. The lights are on all the time.\n\nDo you have a place nearby to you that has lights on all the time? Can you use your Detective Drawing Skills to make a map for me? You can use the blank grid paper on the next page. Draw your ‘lights on all the time’ place on it too. This way we can start to build a bigger ghost map.\n\nWhen you’re done, send a picture of your map to me at squishysleuthing@gmail.com, and I’ll reply. Check your junk mail if you don’t hear from me!",

    "chapterFour": "I got to the nature strip. I couldn’t get my camera to work but I did see some unusual things. The dirt in the nature strip looked like someone—or something—had just been digging around it. I also found a few things lying around the dirt so I put them into my backpack.\n\nI almost made it back in time when I saw Dad coming out of the lift. I couldn’t believe it; I was going to get busted for trying to make a ghost video!\n\n“Squishy, what are you doing out here?” he said. He paused, frowning. “I don’t suppose you came downstairs to buy ice-cream for surprise dessert.”\n\nI couldn’t tell him. So I lied.\n\n“Um. I dropped Baby’s favourite toy on the footpath. I went out to find it.”\n\nI could tell that Dad was disappointed with me. As we went up the elevator together, he told me I needed better communication skills. Once we got inside, he got Mum online to Zoom with me. She didn’t yell at me though. “We’re not angry with you, kiddo,” she said. “We’re just keen for you to tell us your plans. Then we can negotiate or compromise.” When Mum finished speaking with me, I went to Dad.\n\n“Mayyyybe next time I want to go out at night, I should ask you first?” I said.\n\nDad grinned. “I might just surprise you and say yes.”\n\nBack in my room, I put my camera away. I opened my backpack and took out what I’d found at the nature strip. I’m sure this has something to do with the ghosts.",
