    "chapterOne": "Hi! It’s me, Squishy Taylor. I love solving mysteries! And I’m pretty good at it!\n\nEveryone calls me Squishy but my real name is Sita. I live in the city with my Dad, Alice, Baby and Jessie and Vee, my bonus sisters. I call them that because it’s way better than calling them my step-sisters.\n\nne of the best things about bonus sisters is sharing a triple bunk bed! Alice built that for us. Alice is Jessie and Vee’s mum. My Mum is living in Geneva at the moment. She’s working for the UN. “Hey kiddo,” she says whenever we Zoom, “tell me all about your day.” And even if she’s in the middle of doing important UN stuff, she listens to me without checking emails or looking at her phone. I miss her so much.\n\nI miss my bonus sisters too! It’s school holidays right now, and Jessie and Vee are with their Nai Nai in Queensland.\n\nI’ve been stuck at home with nothing to do. And then I saw the news today. Did you? I’ve put it on the next page for you to see."
