    text: `Hi! It’s me, Squishy Taylor. I love solving mysteries! And I’m pretty good at it!

          Everyone calls me Squishy but my real name is Sita. I live in the city with my Dad, Alice, 
          Baby and Jessie and Vee, my bonus sisters. I call them that because it’s way better than 
          calling them my step-sisters.

          One of the best things about bonus sisters is sharing a triple bunk bed! Alice built that for us. 
          Alice is Jessie and Vee’s mum. My Mum is living in Geneva at the moment. She’s working for the UN. 
          “Hey kiddo,” she says whenever we Zoom, “tell me all about your day.” And even if she’s in the 
          middle of doing important UN stuff, she listens to me without checking emails or looking at her phone. 
          I miss her so much.

          I miss my bonus sisters too! It’s school holidays right now, and Jessie and Vee are with their 
          Nai Nai in Queensland.

          I’ve been stuck at home with nothing to do. And then I saw the news today. Did you? I’ve put it 
          on the next page for you to see.`,

    text: `You’ve definitely proved that you’re excellent at sleuthing. I’d love for you to solve this 
          ghost mystery with me!

          You’re right, the three places the ghosts have visited near me are the playground, bus shelter 
          and car park. These places have one thing in common. The lights are on all the time.

          Do you have a place nearby to you that has lights on all the time? Can you use your Detective 
          Drawing Skills to make a map for me? Draw your ‘lights on all the time’ place on it too. 
          This way we can start to build a bigger ghost map.

          When you’re done, send your map to me at squishysleuthing@gmail.com, that’s 
          S Q U I S H Y S L E U T H I N G @gmail.com and I’ll reply – check your junk mail if you don’t 
          hear from me!`,

    text: `Thanks for that map. That definitely looks like a place where the lights are on day and night. 
    I’ve given your location a code name. It’s Big Dipper—the brightest stars in the sky!

    Your map made me think of a couple of things. If the ghosts appear where the lights are on, they 
    actually want us to see them. What do they want us to see though?

    I also remembered this nature strip near me that’s always lit. I’m sure the ghosts will go there 
    tonight. If I can venture into the night and set up a camera there, I can record the ghosts and watch the 
    video in the morning. Maybe I can see what they’re trying to show us.

    Can you help me find the best time to sneak out?`,
